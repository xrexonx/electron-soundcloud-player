# electron-soundcloud-player

A simple music player using Electron, ReactJS and the SoundCloud API.

**Clone and run for a quick way to see this Electron Sound Cloud App player in action.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
